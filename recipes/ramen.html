    <h1>How to make Ramen</h1>
    <p>This might not follow the exact easy peasy directions on the back of a ramen packet, but the extra few minutes to make this simple-but-elevated ramen are more than worth it.</p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <p>Stir-Fry Aromatics: Garlic and ginger, what a delicious duo. This is where the flavor is, friends.</p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Make Your (Easy!) Broth: Add some chicken broth and dried shiitake mushrooms for some umami punch.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Add Noodles: Cook your noodles right in the broth with some scallions (more flavor, please!).</p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>Add Veg: Thinly sliced kale, shredded carrots, whatever you'd like! Cook until just tender.</p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p>Top It Off: Add some crunchy panko crumbs, a soft-boiled egg, chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce, whatever your heart desires.</p>

    <h3>NOTICE</h3>
    <p>Simmering some garlic, ginger, and dried mushrooms with your chicken broth makes for a great quickie “stock”. A good while in the pot will get some nice flavors going that will soon be soaked up by those noodles. And by good while, I mean 19 minutes, because the whole thing takes 20. The soft egg on top will get you all the Instagram likes, and the panko and extra chili oil or Sriracha will light your mouth up with joy.
    <br>
    At the end of the day, a deep bowl of bright veggies + flavorful broth + golden panko crumbs + soft-boiled egg + chewy, tangled noodles is not going to let you down.</p>
